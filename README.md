> A data pack for 1.14x-1.19x

## Features

Hostile mobs dig out of the ground or poof into existence when they spawn.

**Works with:**
Zombies, Zombie Villagers, Husks, Drowned, Skeletons, Strays, Spiders, Cave Spiders, Creepers, Vexes, Witches, Pillagers, Evokers, Vindicators, Illusioners, Slimes, Magma Cubes, Wither Skeletons, Hoglins, Zombified Piglins, Striders, Enderman, Endermites and Giants.

This pack does not affect vanilla gameplay, since the entities that have not yet come out of the ground are only invisible and silent.

If you want to exclude an entity you can use the tag "exclude" or edit the JSON files located in spawnanimations/data/spawnanimations/tags/entity_types/... to even include mobs

## Updates

To check for updates use `/trigger menu` and hit the Check for Updates button. There is also a **Reset** and an **Uninstall** button.

## Compatibility

Data packs are usually pretty compatible with newer versions of the game. This data pack however also features a version checker which notifies you, if you are playing with an (to the data pack) unknown version. If the data pack works fine and I'm just too lazy to update it in time, you can turn it off with the command `/scoreboard players set tvc_ignore global 1`
