> A data pack/mod for Minecraft 1.14x-1.21x

## Features

Hostile mobs dig out of the ground or poof into existence when they spawn.

**Works with:**
Zombies, Husks, Drowned, Skeletons, Strays, Spiders, Cave Spiders, Creepers, Slimes, Magma Cubes, Wither Skeletons, Hoglins, Zombified Piglins, Striders, Enderman and Giants.

This data pack/mod is designed to be as unintrusive as possible. Hidden entities including their worn armor and tools will only be invisible and silent.

This data pack/mod is completely server-side, but can also be installed on the client for singleplayer worlds!

[âžœ For available settings and customization, take a look at the wiki](https://github.com/Tschipcraft/spawnanimations/wiki)

More sophisticated animations with Animated Java are planned for v2.0.
