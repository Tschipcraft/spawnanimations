> A data pack for 1.14x-1.19x

## Features

Hostile mobs dig out of the ground or poof into existence when they spawn.

**Works with:**
Zombies, Zombie Villagers, Husks, Drowned, Skeletons, Strays, Spiders, Cave Spiders, Creepers, Vexes, Witches, Pillagers, Evokers, Vindicators, Illusioners, Slimes, Magma Cubes, Wither Skeletons, Hoglins, Zombified Piglins, Striders, Enderman, Endermites and Giants.

This pack does not affect vanilla gameplay, since the entities that have not yet come out of the ground are only invisible and silent.

If you want to exclude an entity you can use the tag "exclude" or edit the JSON files located in spawnanimations/data/spawnanimations/tags/entity_types/... to even include mobs.
