- **Entities with emissive layers are now properly hidden** ðŸ‘» (Endermen, Spiders, and Cave Spiders) (closes [#25](https://github.com/Tschipcraft/spawnanimations/issues/25))
  - For this feature to work in Minecraft 1.20.4 and below, [Pehkui](https://modrinth.com/project/t5W7Jfwy) must be installed. Pehkui can still be installed in newer versions for smoother poof animations
- Added config options to enable/disable the poof animation ([#40](https://github.com/Tschipcraft/spawnanimations/issues/40)), animation sounds (closes [#39](https://github.com/Tschipcraft/spawnanimations/issues/39)), reducing the number of particles emitted by hidden Endermen, and hiding emissive mob layers ([#25](https://github.com/Tschipcraft/spawnanimations/issues/25))
- Improved performance by refactoring entity activation distance calculations to bundle and cache position data retrieval calls and by updating batch activation logic. The whole project is now up to 45% faster per tick!
- Modified the attack predicate of the secondary dig-up requirements so that it disregards the Y-distance. This allows mobs to, for example, appear at the bottom of pillars if a player decides to build up during the night
- Added an activation distance recommendation message when using the Vanilla activation mode
- Removed the Hoglin from the dig up animation
- Fixed most compatibility issues with [Hostile Mobs Improve Over Time](https://modrinth.com/project/ku4JD9TH) by adding missing tag recovery logic when preparing an entity for hiding. This should generally improve compatibility with other packs that override entity tags (closes [#26](https://github.com/Tschipcraft/spawnanimations/issues/26))
- Fixed poof animation playing multiple times when "Play Animation on Unsupported Blocks" is off
- Fixed possibility of hidden falling mobs losing their fall distance NBT when appearing
- Fixed v0 save format not correctly upgrading to v1 in 1.20.5 and 1.20.6 (precisely from 24w11a to 24w20a)
- Changed exclude tag from `exclude` to `ts.sa.exclude`
